    <h2> Chapter 1: My Hobby </h2>

    <p class="intro"> My primary hobby is to play video games, either independently or with friends. 
        My favorite genre to play is RPG's (roleplaying games) when I'm playing solo. 
        When I'm with friends, the genre tends to shift a lot from shooters to indie horror.</p>
    <p> Typically when I'm playing solo, I like to find a game that has a compelling story that catches and holds my attention. 
        I usually take my time through the RPG's I play and explore the various segments of the world the game has to offer. 
        I tend to take longer to play some story games then others as a result, but I don't care because I'm enjoying what I do.</p>
    <p> Things are a bit different when playing with friends. 
        I play a small number of genres solo, but with freinds the variety shifts significantly. 
        We could be play a horror game one moment and shift to a simple puzzle game the next. 
        I enjoy playing games with them when I can, though sometimes I can't do that as much as I'd like.</p>
    <p> <span class="sentence">When I'm not playing games, I usually spend time at work or doing schoolwork</span>. 
        I hope to finish school and get a job developing video games one day, whether with a company or independently. 
        As long as I can make more money doing something closer to what I enjoy, I'll be happy.</p>
