        <h3> 5 Things I've Learned Since the Course Started </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> How to code in HTML and CSS of course </li>
            <li> The brain uses more processing power when imagining things versus simply remembering them </li>
            <li> The brain fills in the blanks based on patterns and expectations when reading text, rather than actually seeing the words</li>
            <li> The style of an HTML file is done typically though a CSS file, though it's not technically necessary </li>
            <li> Vivid memories may seem like something you'd remember in detail, but in actuality you aren't remembering the exact scenario because your brain is reconstructing the experience </li>
        </ul>
